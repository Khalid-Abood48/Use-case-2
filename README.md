# Use-case-2
# World Happiness Analysis README

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the World Happiness Reports from 2015 to 2019 to gain insights into global happiness trends and factors contributing to happiness. The analysis will involve several key steps, including defining the problem statement, collecting data, data quality checking and remediation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building machine learning models, model evaluation, communicating results, model deployment, and model performance maintenance in production.

## Use Case 2: Analyzing World Happiness
### Step 1: Defining the Problem Statement
We seek to understand various aspects of global happiness:
- Identify countries or regions with the highest overall happiness scores and examine the factors contributing to their happiness.
- Analyze changes in country rankings or scores between the years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017.
- Identify any significant increases or decreases in happiness among countries.
- *Additional questions for exploration are welcome.*

### Step 2: Collecting Data
Data from the World Happiness Reports spanning five years (2015-2019) has been collected for analysis.

### Step 3: Data Quality Checking and Remediation
Data quality checking and remediation tasks will be performed in the notebook to ensure the integrity and reliability of the dataset.

### Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA will involve exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. Key analyses will include visualizations and statistical summaries to gain insights into global happiness factors and trends over time.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `EDA explain template.ipynb`.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each step of the analysis process.
5. Explore the results and visualizations generated to gain insights into global happiness trends.
